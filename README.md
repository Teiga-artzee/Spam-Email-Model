# Spam-Email-Model
Using R studio, the frequency of words found in Spam is used to help filter and detect these emails

A visual representation of the words are created in a word cloud.
The model proves using the Naive Baynes algorithm that a Machine Learning model
can reliably filter through word frequency to deterimine if contents of a file (or email) can
be used to determine if the file(email) is spam.
